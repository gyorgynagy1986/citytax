              (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) regulation concerning the
              protection of personal data and privacy of individuals. It addresses
              the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA as well. The
              GDPR aims to provide individuals with greater control over their
              personal data and harmonize data protection laws in the EU.

              destruction. The GDPR establishes strict rules regarding the
              collection, use, and sharing of personal data, and grants various
              rights to individuals concerning their personal data, including the
              right to access, rectify, delete, and restrict processing.

              must also ensure that third parties processing personal data on
              their behalf do so in compliance with the GDPR.
